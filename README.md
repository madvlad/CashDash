#CashDash 

A proof of concept and demo application for Microsoft Hololens


##Description

In CashDash you race against the clock to collect all the coins as fast as you can. The faster you collect them the closer you are to getting the gold.


##Gameplay

A course is a sequence of coins placed around your real world environment that you must run and collect. The time goes from 0:00 up to however long it takes for you to finish the course. The lower your time the better.


One coin is shown at a time. Collecting a coin reveals the location of the next coin.


Skulls add 5 seconds to your time when they are collected and they should be avoided.

Clocks remove 10 seconds from your time.

##Setup

To start this project you must have the following installed:
 * Unity for Hololens (5.4)
 * Visual Studio 2015 with Update 3
 * HoloToolkit from [Microsoft's github](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity)
